Hi,

this is a clean slate for checking benchmarks.
You choose a tag BUILDOUT_BATTLE and check the tag out.
Create a virtualenv.
Manually install pillow.
Run Buildout.
Run Tests with ``test bin/test``

The tests must all pass. If this worked, add them to the
results list. The results list is the same as the tag name,
plus a .txt
Numbers betweedn these different results have no meaning.
