Test failures
-------------

Products.ExtendedPathIndex

"ImportError: cannot import name ImplC"

All tests fail probably caused by some import cycle problem.


PasswordResetTool/tests/browser.txt

Lot's of problems with changed form output, but also deeper down problems with
method trying to get to the request via self.REQUEST


Products.PluggableAuthService

LocationError: ('No traversable adapter found', ...)

Presumably some missing ZCML loading.


Products.ResourceRegistries

Messed up in many ways. portal_kss isn't installed anymore by default Plone
profile -> RR needs its own test profile.
