+Introduction
+============
+
+``plone.app.debugtoolbar`` provides a wealth of debug information about a
+running Plone site at your fingertips. Simply install it in your build
+(e.g. by adding it to the ``eggs`` list in your Buildout and re-running
+buildout) and install it into your Plone site.
+
+You should now see a ``Debug`` link at the top of your site. Click it to open
+the debug drawer. Click on a panel to view relevant information.
+
+Panels include:
+
+* Context, showing information about the current content object
+* Interactive, providing an interactive Python prompt through which you can
+  interact with the current context (only available to users with the
+  ``Manage portal`` permission)
+* Request, showing information about the request that produced the current page
+* Response, showing informationa about the response that produced the current
+  page
+* Published, showing information about the page template or view that was
+  published
+* Theme, showing information about the current theme and browser layers
+* User, showing information about the current user
+* Workflow, showing information about workflow and security
+* Zope, showing information about how the Zope server is configured
+* Versions, listing the versions of every package known to the Zope process
+
+Safety
+======
+
+The debug toolbar provides a lot of information about your Plone site that you
+may not want the world to know. It could also have a noticable performance
+impact, and for users with the ``Manage portal`` permission it provides access
+to an interactive interpreter where arbitrary Python statements can be executed,
+allowing a user to bypass Zope security.
+
+In other words: **Do not install this package on your production server**.
+
+Integration
+===========
+
+Each panels is included as a viewlet. You can register new panels using a
+viewlet registration like this::
+
+    <browser:viewlet
+        name="plone.app.debugtoolbar.somepanel"
+        manager="plone.app.debugtoolbar.browser.interfaces.IDebugToolbarViewletManager"
+        class=".somepanel.SomePanelViewlet"
+        template="somepanel.pt"
+        permission="zope2.View"
+        layer="plone.app.debugtoolbar.browser.interfaces.IDebugToolbarLayer"
+        />
+
+See ``plone.app.debugtoolbar.browser`` for plenty of examples of panels.
