+Changelog
+=========
+
+1.2.2 (unreleased)
+------------------
+
+* Allow content-to-content inclusion
+  [elro, ebrehault]
+
+
+1.2.1 (2015-09-07)
+------------------
+
+* Absolute prefix support for srcset attributes
+  [huubbouma]
+
+
+1.2.0 (2015-09-03)
+------------------
+
+* Extend cssselect instead of using experimental.cssselect
+  [elro]
+
+
+1.1.2 (2015-09-03)
+------------------
+
+* Allow inline content for after and before.
+  [ebrehault, elro]
+
+* Fixed issue with remote themes via https connections
+  [loechel]
+
+
+1.1.1 (2015-03-21)
+------------------
+
+* Make flake8 happy by moving imports to top of file.
+  [elro]
+
+
+1.1.0 (2014-10-23)
+------------------
+
+* Python 3 support.
+  [regebro, elro]
+
+
+1.0.6 (2014-09-11)
+------------------
+
+* Use formencode's xml_compare method to compare test results. This solves test
+  failures on several systems.
+  [timo]
+
+* Also evaluate if-not-content. However, we are at risk of replicating
+  apply-conditions.xsl in it's entirety. this needs refactoring.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Remove any xml:lang attribute from content to prevent multiple
+  xml:lang attributes when the html tag's attributes are copied.
+  [danjacka]
+
+1.0.5 (2014-01-27)
+------------------
+
+* Escape curly brackets on theme attributes.
+  [TracyWebTech]
+
+1.0.4 (2013-08-14)
+------------------
+
+* Provide the request's query string as the ``$query_string`` variable
+  for use in the rules file.
+  [davidjb]
+
+* Fix ``diazo.scheme`` definition to be correct. Previously, this was
+  defined as ``request.host``.
+  [davidjb]
+
+1.0.3 (2012-11-11)
+------------------
+
+* Support selectors matching multiple elements for merge attributes, e.g.
+  ``<merge attributes="class" css:theme="body" css:content="#one, #two"/>``
+  [elro]
+
+* Also evaluate merged-condition. This means a rule tag will turn red
+  when a condition on an outer rules tag doesn't match.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* use boolean(), not count() for if-content. Otherwise we
+  generate expressions like "count(nodeset and other_nodeset)",
+  which aren't valid.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Output contents of error log as part of debugging output
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Debugging output.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Don't close the response unless Diazo is transforming it.
+  [mitchellrj]
+
+* fix error caused by empty style tag e.g. <style/>
+  [djay]
+
+1.0.2 (2012-08-30)
+------------------
+
+* Handle error when serializing empty responses by returning an unthemed
+  response. Previously, empty text/html responses resulted in an raised
+  exception, resulting in a 500 response and no output.
+  [davidjb]
+
+* Allow attributes (i.e. xml:id) to pass through on drop @attribute nodes
+  [lentinj]
+
+1.0.1 (2012-05-09)
+------------------
+
+* Fixed to not apply absolute prefix for relative urls starting with '#'.
+  [datakurre]
+
+1.0 (2012-04-15)
+----------------
+
+* Preserve resolvers in the rules document when updating from an old namespace.
+
+* Add javascript / css include support to WSGIResolver.
+
+* Refactoring if WSGI middleware to use WebOb better and fix corner cases.
+
+* Use same xpath prefix for css:if-not-content and css:if-content.
+
+* Add support for @if-not-path.
+
+1.0rc4 - 2011-11-02
+-------------------
+
+* Add support for @if-not and @if-not-content.
+
+* Add support for specifying mode on inclusion rules.
+
+* Preserve comments preceding/following html tag in theme. Closes #12249.
+
+* Fix quote_param to always use lxml.etree.XSLT.strparam.
+
+* Handle rules file without a theme to allow drop or replace content.
+
+1.0rc3 - 2011-07-04
+-------------------
+
+* Support for ``filter_xpath`` requests for ESI/SSI includes.
+
+* Do not try to transform HEAD requests, otherwise you get:
+  ``XMLSyntaxError: no element found``.
+  [maurits]
+
+1.0rc2 - 2011-06-08
+-------------------
+
+* Fix detection of Content-Type.
+
+* Add doctype option to wsgi middleware to support HTML5 output.
+
+* Fix line endings for included external content.
+
+1.0rc1 - 2011-05-24
+-------------------
+
+* Fix diazocompiler --output option.
+
+1.0b4 - 2011-05-17
+------------------
+
+* Implement drop theme-children.
+
+1.0b3 - 2011-05-16
+------------------
+
+* Filter out additional xmlns with notheme.
+
+1.0b2 - 2011-04-27
+------------------
+
+* Enable attribute to be included from external documents.
+
+* Enable use of variables/parameters in drop/strip/replace content rule
+  conditions.
+
+* Fix a bug whereby a theme could not be loaded from a network location
+  even if read_network was enabled.
+
+1.0b1 - 2011-04-22
+------------------
+
+* Updated css namespace url to http://namespaces.plone.org/diazo/css
+
+* Added <replace content="...">...</replace> directive.
+
+* Added the ``wsgi`` module, which contains a WSGI middleware filter for
+  applying a Diazo themes, as well as a lower level one for applying an
+  XSLT transformation to HTML output.
+
+* Moved documentation from the README to the diazo.org website. See
+  http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.org/diazo-docs/trunk.
+
+* Added ``<merge />`` directive
+
+* Added ``<notheme />`` directive
+
+* Added ``<strip />`` directive
+
+* Revised rule set to be based on ``theme-children`` and ``content-children``
+  and an explicit ``attributes`` parameter. ``<copy />`` is now only used for
+  copying of attributes. ``<prepend />`` and ``<append />`` are deprecated
+  in favour of ``<before />`` and ``<after />`` using ``theme-children``.
+
+* Use experimental.cssselect to better work with location paths.
+
+* Renamed XDV to Diazo.
+
+0.4b3 - 2010-09-09
+------------------
+
+* Path conditions with @if-path.
+
+* Serialize using XSLT method in diazorun to respect <xsl:output method="html"/>
+
+* Fix for default theme.
+
+* Fix for themes in nested rules tags.
+
+0.4b2 - 2010-08-16
+------------------
+
+* When no conditional themes match, pass the document through without theming.
+
+* Fix loading of compiler stylesheets so as not to be affected by resolvers.
+
+0.4b1 - 2010-08-06
+------------------
+
+* Multistage compiler breaks down work into smaller, more easily debugged
+  chunks. (In the spirit of the original DVNG prototype.)
+
+* Refactoring of generated XSLT to perform its work in a single pass, bringing
+  a 30-50% speedup.
+
+* Multiple theme support using the new <theme> directive.
+
+* Nested <rules> and condition merging allows for condition grouping.
+
+* Allow comments to be selected in the theme.
+
+* Tweaked ``ssi`` includemode for Apache compatibility. The previous
+  ``wait="yes"`` behaviour no longer seems necessary with current versions of
+  Nginx, but is available using the ``ssiwait`` includemode.
+
+* CSS expressions are now converted to relative rather than absolute xpaths.
+  While this makes no difference to their use in diazo directives (which are
+  executed in the context of the root node), more flexibility is available
+  when used with inline XSL.

+------------------

+* Updated css namespace url to http://namespaces.plone.org/diazo/css
+
+* Added <replace content="...">...</replace> directive.
+
+* Added the ``wsgi`` module, which contains a WSGI middleware filter for
+  applying a Diazo themes, as well as a lower level one for applying an
+  XSLT transformation to HTML output.
+
+* Moved documentation from the README to the diazo.org website. See
+  http://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/plone.org/diazo-docs/trunk.
+

+* Added ``<notheme />`` directive
+
+* Added ``<strip />`` directive
+
+* Revised rule set to be based on ``theme-children`` and ``content-children``

+
+0.4b1 - 2010-08-06
+------------------
+
+* Multistage compiler breaks down work into smaller, more easily debugged
+  chunks. (In the spirit of the original DVNG prototype.)
+
+* Refactoring of generated XSLT to perform its work in a single pass, bringing
+  a 30-50% speedup.
+
+* Multiple theme support using the new <theme> directive.
+
+* Nested <rules> and condition merging allows for condition grouping.
+
+* Allow comments to be selected in the theme.
+
+* Tweaked ``ssi`` includemode for Apache compatibility. The previous
+  ``wait="yes"`` behaviour no longer seems necessary with current versions of
+  Nginx, but is available using the ``ssiwait`` includemode.
+
+* CSS expressions are now converted to relative rather than absolute xpaths.
+  While this makes no difference to their use in diazo directives (which are
+  executed in the context of the root node), more flexibility is available
+  when used with inline XSL.
