+Overview
+========
+
+plone.contentrules provides a "pure Zope" implementation of a a rules engine
+which allows arbitrary conditions and actions to be combined into rules, and
+rules to be executed dependent on events.
+
+You can think of this as somewhat similar to user-assembled mail filtering rules
+or something like Apple's Automator. It is used by plone.app.contentrules to
+provide such functionality for Plone.
