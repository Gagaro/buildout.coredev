+Changelog
+=========
+
+1.2.8 (unreleased)
+------------------
+
+* Render CSS as link, no css-import. This allows cooking with other
+  link rendered css and gives better asynchronous download behavior.
+  [thet]
+
+
+1.2.7 (2014-10-20)
+------------------
+
+* make compatible with jQuery >= 1.9
+  [petschki]
+
+
+1.2.6 (2013-12-07)
+------------------
+
+* Fix url in css for indicator.gif
+  [mitakas]
+
+
+1.2.5 (2013-08-23)
+------------------
+
+* Use jQuery.prop() instead of jQuery.attr() to deselect radio buttons.
+* Only do list marshalling for multiple selection.
+* Handle the case where the server responds with 204 No Content.
+
+1.2.4 (2012-10-23)
+------------------
+
+* Switch the default parser to use the title as the value, so that titles
+  are used to autocomplete what's in the text input box.
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Add a custom parse function that defaults to an identical function to the
+  default one.
+  [lentinj]
+
+1.2.3 (2012-02-13)
+------------------
+
+* Fix <input /> element generation for Internet Explorer; in most cases, the
+  generated element would be lacking the name attribute.
+  [mj]
+
+1.2.2 (2011-09-24)
+------------------
+
+* Add whitespace after autocreated radio buttons, fixing alignment:
+  http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=193 (thanks davidjb)
+  [lentinj]
+
+1.2.1 (2011-05-16)
+------------------
+
+* Use full widget name in ++widget++ path, don't try and remove form prefix
+  (which will not behave correctly if widget is part of a subform).
+  [lentinj]
+
+1.2.0 (2011-04-30)
+------------------
+
+* Add upgrade step to register formwidget-autocomplete.js, bumping profile
+  version to 1
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Split input:radio adding function so the code can be reused when adding
+  in plone.formwidget.contenttree
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Move the javascript callback to real code, so instances of the widget
+  can be added to the page by cloning existing widgets
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Allow overriding of the autocomplete URL
+  [lentinj]
+
+* Fix htmlDecode to return an element, not the nodeValue of an element which
+  is null.
+  [ggozad]
+
+* No longer include the `demo.zcml` by default, but rather allow users to
+  include it if needed.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Update distribution metadata.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Remove direct `zope.app` dependencies.
+  [hannosch]
+
+* Use the correct ViewPageTemplateFile from Five required in a Zope 2 context.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.1.1 (2011-02-11)
+------------------
+
+* Explicitly include CMFCore's zcml in demo.zcml, for compatibility
+  with Zope 2.13.
+  [davisagli]
+
+1.1 (2010-08-25)
+----------------
+
+* Force the inserted HTML radio buttons to be interpreted as HTML
+  instead of text.
+  [dukebody]
+
+* Fall back to the site to perform content-related operations if the
+  context is not wrapped into an aquisition chain.
+  [dukebody]
+
+* Compute the view name as the request URL left-stripped the content
+  absolute URL.
+  [dukebody]
+
+* Use the same display template for single- and multi-selection:
+  The single selection display template was non functional before.
+  The value of a single selection field is wrapped in a list anyways
+  so the multiselection template renders the single selection field
+  just fine.
+  -> https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10495
+
+* Update widget in the autocomplete-search browser view:
+  The self.context.update() call rebinds to source which previously
+  was only bound during traversal. This avoids problems with
+  sources that only work after security is applied.
+  [gaudenzius]
+
+1.0 - 2010-04-19
+----------------
+
+* Issue 107: plone.formwidget.autocomplete: problems in IE8 when changing value
+  Added a JavaScript work around, which dechecks all existing radio fields before
+  adding a new one which is checked.
+  [jbaumann]
+
+* Made the widget work properly in Zope 2.12.
+  [optilude]
+
+1.0b3 - 2009-06-29
+------------------
+
+* Fix security validator to work properly on add views and other views using
+  namespace traversal (++add++...)
+  [optilude]
+
+1.0b2 - 2009-04-08
+------------------
+
+* Fix security validator to work with urls not including the @@ view name.
+  [optilude]
+
+* Made widget use getURL() instead of constructing URL from underlying
+  view. This makes it work with complex traversal logic.
+  [optilude]
+
+1.0b1 - 2008-08-28
+------------------
+
+* Initial release
