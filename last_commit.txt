-NOTES from ploneconf2010 open space
-===================================
-
-focus on finishing
-------------------
-* widget (datepicker & recurrencewidget)
-* calendar & events portlets
-* export ical (maybe also vcal. thet is suggesting to drop support for vcal since it's an really old standard)
-* whole day events
-* more daterecurringindex tests
-
-* migration work can be done after plip
-
-more
-----
-
-* rss support
-
-* calendar views
-    monthly view, weekly view, daily view
-
-* hcal microformat
-
-IDEA:
-    when deleting an occurence of an recurring event from calendar view,
-    deleting should be faked by adding an exclusion date
-    google calendar does that thing
-
-
-timezone issues
----------------
-    don't use timezone information at all?
-        NO. better not.
-    save and display dates in users local timezone
-         timezone from request, set by user's browser
-    confusing usecase:
-        german guy editing events in bristol.
-        adapting timezone when editing and displaying
-    google calendar: asks if event should be displayed in users local timezone
-    or timezone of event location
-    when using timezones, tz information must be updated regulary and often
-    (several times in the year). admins won't be very happy beeing in such a
-    situation.
-
-discussion
-----------
-
-* archetype datetime
-    see c.z3cform.datetimewidget
-
-* archetype recurrence event widget
-    see z3cform recurrence event widget
-
-* subclassing ATEvent possible? yes, should be.
-
-hcal microformat
-ical/vcal, drop vcal?

-TODO
-====
-
-* There seems to be a problem with exclusion rulesets and timezones. There is
-a possibility that different results for start and end dates are produced. This has
-to be fixed (documented above in howto).
-
-* Andreas Jung reported a problem where the enddate is incorrectly validated. This
-has to be fixed.
-
-- Check all packages for correct Licenses
-- Add tests to ensure, DateRecurringIndex is actually installed.
-- Make event.recurrence not an ATFieldProperty, since that is deprecated
-- For recurring events, which have occurrences in the future, show future
-occurrences first and hide past occurrences with javascript or so. Needs new
-methods (next_occurrences, past_occurrences, next_occurence, previous_occurence)
-in RecurrenceSupport event adapter.
-- upgrade step for portlets move into plone.app.event. see traceback http://pastebin.com/YFyCytXg
-- add <property name="index_naive_time_as_local">True</property> property for
-  start and end indexes in catalog.xml as soon as P.DRI has that extra property
-- write tests to check if events and calendar portlets work with recurrence. manual test was ok.
-- add deprecation warnings for imports from ATContentTypes
-- make BBB back-imports of CT, utilities, interfaces, etc in ATContentTypes and deprecate them
-- leave utils.txt with it's date conversion functions and test_bugs.py back in
-  P.ATCT, but deprecate them.
-- upgrade step to recatalog the start and end indexes
-- make calendar widget display (hidden) the timezone
-- add a hook to getICal(), getVCal() for retrieving additional data
-  from derived event types
-- check how much sense start&end metadata columns in catalog.xml make sense.
-  they return start&end of first occurence but nothing else.
-  --> guess its used by folder_listing displaying start and end time from brain info.
-- think about storing all dates in utc and converting them on display to
-  localized time.
-  usecase where this won't work: dates going over DST borders. like meeting from
-  oktober-november shouldn't change the relative time
-
-OUT OF SCOPE FOR NOW - let P.Archetypes set the timezone regarding the timezone
-set in the request/user's browser.
-
-OK - Make event.whole_day not an ATFieldProperty, since that is deprecated
-OK - Check dependencies in setup.py for every package
-OK - set start and end for wholedayevents to 0:00, resp, 23:59:59
-         - test whole day event handler
-OK - check display of recurring events
-  OK - start date included twice
-  OK - line breaks btw dates
-  OK - recurrence dates wrongly displayed
-OK - use plone.event.utils.pydt instead of DT2dt - it uses real timezones and
-     converts the date to UTC if the timezone cant be retrieved (like: GMT+1
-     is a GMT/UTC offset, but not a "real" timezone where daylight saving
-     changes can be derived).
-OK - update calendar-portlet and move it into plone.app.event
-OK - update events-portlet and move it into plone.app.event
-OK - actually test, if calendar and events portlets work with recurrence
-OK - check use of MessageFactory. should message factory be in plone namespace?
-  yes
-OK - synchronize package with newest ATContentTypes (diff modified with trunk)
-OK - clean up recurrence code and only use new rrulestring implementation
-OBSOLETE - rename package to plone.app.calendar and create one for
-    plone.calendar (e.g. for RFC2445 definitions)
-OK - test for disabled recurrence and None values to store in recurrence field.
-    see how index is behaving
-
-Future
-======
-- integrate hcal microformat
-- use plone.testing and plone.app.testing
-
-TODO for Plone
-==============
-OK - depend on plone.app.event
-Ok - include plone.app.event package in configure.zcml
-OK - include plone.app.event in metadata.xml GS profile
-OK - remove catalog index and metadata column and use those in plone.app.event

-
-OK ... that item is done
-IP ... that item is in progress
-ISSUED ... moved to github tracker
-

-
-TODO
-====
-OK - plone.app.collection: integrate, add relative time delta
-
-ISSUED - generalize IRecurrence adapter. move out o' contenttypes and use generic
-  event accessor to access event's attributes.
-
-ISSUED - use generic event accessor also for ical serialization. no need for
-  content-type specific adapters then.
-
-ISSUED - plone.app.event.at in seperate egg...
-
-ISSUED - GMT offsets have to be supported ... maybe a converter btw olson and GMT . look
-into pytz for a converter
-
-ISSUED - timezone getting/in which timezone is an event displayed. --/ document!
-generic event aceesor : also for json...
-
-whole day handler : good self speaking test cases, 
-
-timezone of the request???
-ISSUED - different timezone conversion strategies.... > display always in portal timezone, display in user timezone..., ...
-ISSUED - prefix with _...
-
-BUG
----
-
-OK - recurring events: when searching for events within a timeframe, the
-IRecurrence.occurrences method possibly returned a list where starts and ends
-are of different lenght, leading into an error.  now, the end dates of the
-occurrences list are calculated from the start date + a duration.
-
-OK+Test: calendarportlet: unicodedecodeerror with umlauts in title, desc or location.
-
-
-portlet_calendar
-++++++++++++++++
-- next/previous: overlay displays raw-overlay string
-ISSUED - remove kss dependency, use jquery-only
-
-
-PLONECONF TALk
---------------
-
-ISSUED - fix icalendar timezone export
-
-OK - plone.formwidget.datetime
-OK -    fix for AT and DX
-
-OK polish dx type
-OK    integrate recurrence widget
-OK    defaults for recurrencewidget.
-OK    ical export
-
-OK fix vincentfretin's start/end js (unify datetime templates for that?)
-
-ISSUED - create uninstall profiles
-OK - create pre-plone43 profiles (uninstalls default plone stuff)
-
-
-thet
-----
-
-ISSUED thet - fix whole_day event export.... end-date is set startdate+1. in some cases end-date is two days after
-start-date. this has something to do with utc conversion...
-or set end-date to same date as start date, which is semantically more correct?
-
-ISSUED FIRST: fix timezone support in icalendar export. then this issue is also gone.
-
-
-thet - atevent: after changes to default_start and default_end, start+end is now 1,
-  resp. 2 hours in future. check why
-
-thet - add portlet_calendar and portlet_events on startpage (this one with unpublished and published events).
-
-thet - show unpublished events as such in portlet_events and portlet_calendar
-
-
-ical
-----
-
-ISSUED - ical export, dx types: UID not present in events
-
-ISSUED - Use VTIMEZONE compoenent and TZID properties in ical exports for every
-  date/datetime
-
-ISSUED - Proper ATTENDEES support for icalendar export
-
-OK - fix tests
-
-
-datetime widget
----------------
-
-WONTFIX - 1) - unify plone.formwidget.datetime templates
-
-OK - 2) - fix vincent's dt-javascript's, which are failing now
-
-- eventually merge supton's uu.smartdate with plone.formwidget.datetime
-  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~upiq-dev/upiq/uu.smartdate/changes
-
-- DX: when calculating default_end time at 23:xx, its 0:xx. the hour component
-  isn't displayed in the datetime widget.
-
-- move parts/omelette/Products/CMFPlone/skins/plone_form_scripts/validate_start_end_date.vpy
-  to plone.formwidget.dateinput or plone.app.event.
-
-OK - years_range - calendar starting year, calendar future years options in datetimewidget.
-
-ISSUED - option: use textinput style with fallback to selectors if no js is avail.
-
-ISSUED - integrate timepicker (adapted from mozi)
-
-
-recurring widget
-----------------
-
-- remove the leading zero 2nd method.
-
-
-index
------
-
-- integrate lennart's plone.app.eventindex
-
-OK (artsprint) - benchmarks for both indices
-
-- usage of IIBTree - see discussion on plone-dev
-test if IIBTrees or set are faster
->>> ts = time.time(); b=difference(IISet(a), IISet(b)); time.time() - ts
-0.014604091644287109
->>> ts = time.time(); b=set(a) - set(b); time.time() - ts
-
-- do we need to add the indices to ATContentTypes.criteria.__init__ indices
-  Constants?
-
-types
------
-
-ISSUED - uninstall profiles
-
-- "no end date" boolean option
-
-
-dexterity behaviors / types
----------------------------
-
-OK - editing DX types with event behavior fails, since a tznaive DT is compared
-    to timzone aware DT. see inline TODO statements.
-
-- in metadata catalog, timezone'd times should reside, not un-timezone'd (see
-    atevent)
-
-- z3cform: for time 0:00, the hour is not displayed. when displaying, 12:00
-    AM is shown.
-
-
-timezone support
-----------------
-
-- eventually provide configlet to configure TZ per user
-  user should be able to select his timezone in user properties
-
-- allow no TZ setting on content context at all - this solves "world plone
-  day" problem (event in different timezones, whole day in every timezone)
-
-- GenericSetup import profile for setting the default timezone on install time
-  (and upgrade time as well).
-
-- if no timezone is selected: same as mail settings: note in nonfig area - at least
-  display in edit form to link in control panel.
-FIXES:
-
-- on fresh install, when creating an event - no timezones are configured and
-  cannot be selected - but are mandatory. at least a default timezone has to
-  be selected in the event-settings configlet. that should be set at install
-  time.
-
-
-documentation
--------------
-
-- plip documentation
-
-- document daterecurringindex benchmark results
-
-- document TZ behavior with examples
-
-- document api to get lsit of event
-
-- sphinx API autodoc?
-
-- document removal of ICalendarSupport (interface for ical export ability) in
-  plone.app.event.interfaces. MAYBE provide that interface in ATContentTypes
-  for backwards compatibility
-
-
-general
--------
-
-ISSUED - Factor out generic methods without plone.app.* or Zope2 dependencies and move
-  them to plone.event.
-
-OK - Solgema * recurrence widget dateinput is behind overlay
-
-- integrate a localized, nice formated duration function
-
-- Rethink the catalog metadata entries. ADD whole_day (Solegma asked for it).
-
-- Generic icalendar types interfaces for event, journal, todo in plone.event
-
-- Check ordering of schema fields.
-
-OK - Refactor tests.
-
-- the content types depend on event handlers.
-  notify(ObjectModifiedEvent(event)) has always to be called manually if object
-  isn't modified by a form. is that failure proof?
-
-- eventually remove recurrence functionality for plip submission?
-
-- improve jenkins integration
-
-
-CMFPlone
---------
-
-- remove portal_skins/plone_content/event_view.pt
-
-- remove portal/icon_export_vcal.png
-
-- remove label_add_to_vcal
-
-
-CMFCalendar deprecation
------------------------
-
-- deprecate/remove portal_calendar from Products.CMFPlone
-
-- migration steps
-
-- Remove calendar configlet from plone.app.controlpanel
-
-- provide an utility for portal-message/warning viewlet info, so that warnings
-  can be injected and that warning-checker code must not be in the
-  controlpanel-overview template anymore.
-
-- permissions of cmfcalendar in plone.app.event, if possible - or drop em.
-  martin says in his book, that cmfcalendar permissions are an historical 
-  accident. upgrade step probably needed.
-
-
-migration steps
----------------
-
-- if default timezone is not set, migration cannot run
-
-- migration from old ATEvent (catalog update)
-
-- Check if any upgrade steps are neccassary for changed permission names (see
-  config.py)
-
-
-future
-------
-
-- provide caldav support, using webdav. make Zope2.webdav obsolete and use
-  z3c.dav or wsgidav or whatever.
-
-- Integrate RSVP - Resource reSerVation Protocol (IP, RFC 2205)
-
-
-
-DONE
-====
-
-OK plone.forminput.recurrence * create z3cform based recurrence widget for use with dx types
-
-OK * register sample DX event with event_view
-
-OK * unify AT and DX event browser view
-
-OK * use p.a.event.base.get_portal_events all over, where needed (e.g. event
-  portlet)
-
-OK * make ical adapters for dx based types
-    OK . remove adapters for IATFolder, etc. since IFolder does the same.
-    NO . can you use IFolder also for IDexterityContainer objects?
-
-OK - DX events: calendar portlet breaks
-
-OK - thet * support allday events in icalendar: export date-only, enddate+1day
-
-OK - Cleanup plone.event for unused methods
-
-OK - Cleanup plone.event for critical dependencies.
-
-OK - thet - ditch Products.CMFCalendar, if possible.
-    in branch - merge-CMFCalendar
-
-    cmfcalendar seems to be only used by calendarportlet.
-    $ grept cmfalendar parts/omelette/*
-
-    OK - thet - calendarportlet: refactoring for removed portal_calendar dependency and 
-      new plone.app.event.base based approach.
-        NO - calendar portlet using jquery tools calendar?
-        - template change, so that a viewlet can also use calendar via
-          metal:macros.
-
-    OK - thet - merge calendar and plone.app.event portlet.
-    OK - reimplement important functionality from calendar configlet
-        -> upgrade step
-
-NO - eventually ditch start_date and end_date, replacing them with more RFC5545
-    names dtstart, dtend...
-    !!! probably NOT. that might cause trouble.
-    !!! on the other hand... it's not used anyways and the api changed from pre
-    plone.app.event ATEvent implementation anyways...
-    $ grept start_date parts/omelette/*
-
-OK - thet (regebro) * finish icalendar 3.0 branch, where __str__ isn't used
-  - to_ical method into event content type. method may use more generic one.
-
-OK - thet (regebro) * rrule freq must be present. make/update validator with that.
-
-OK - thet * make generic ical adapter.
-
-OK - regebro - bring forward plone.formwidget.recurrence and jquery.recurrence
-
-OK * portlets renamed, fix it in old instances: event -> portlet_event, calendar ->
-    portlet_calendar (calendar is a python module.)
-   not needed, since legacy calendar and event modules left in
-   plone.app.portlets.
-
-OK * plone.app.event.browser.event_view.pt -> eventually make view more generic
-  and usable for dx also... by replacing widget-calls
-
-OK - garbas/thet - use icalendar instead of plone.rfc5545 / plone.event
-
-OK - thet - Refactor plone.app.event for usage of an subpackage "at" (later
-    also "dx") where all ATCT (later also dexterity) related stuff resides.
-    when dexterity becomes one day the default content type framework, we won't
-    depend on AT anymore...
-
-OK - thet - archetypes.datetimewidget, collective.z3cform.datetimewidget -> merge into
-  plone.formwidget.dateinput
-
-OK - thet - move tests to plone.app.testing
-
-OK - remove all vcal references in favor or ical
-
-OK - thet - here are git:// and git@ checkouts for ppl without/with rw permissions.
-  maybe https handles both?
-
-OK - ATEvent
-  [X] recurrence field goes after end date.
-  [ ] hide text area with css display:none
-  [X] remove schemata recurrence
-  [ ] provide checkbox "this date recurrs ..." and toggle textarea then
-
-OK - DX Events: Provide it. providing behaviors, based on plone.app.page
-
-OK * dependency on plone.folder as well as plone.app.collection are only for
-  registering ical adapters and might make backporting harder than neccassary.
-  optional via zcml:condition
-
-OK * p.a.event tests: ATEvent cannot be created - the factory method is not created... investigate.
-
-OK - datetimewidget calendar images missing...
-OK - new TZ field on ATEvent. store all dates in UTC timezone. store TZ extra.
-   display dates in user's timezone (via TZ fetcher utility). use getter and
-   setter to calculate timezones (get: UTC-userTZ set: userTZ->UTC).
-OK - provide configlet to configure portal's TZ. use dropdown for
-   default_timezone and in-out-widget for allowed_timezones (which then are
-   used to filter tz's with elephantvocabulary)
-OK - plone.event -> TZ vocabulary
-OK - plone.app.event -> TZ vocabulary based on elephantvocabulary filter
-   get filtered items or display items from plone.registry
-
-OK - TZ fetcher utility
-  OK - plone.event: OS TZ
-  OK - plone.app.event portal TZ
-  - context, user, portal TZ
-
-OK - move buildout configs out of coredev/plip into p.a.event to be used
-  independently
-
-OK - merge branches with trunk
-
-OK - buildout: there is a git checkout which isn't handled by mr.developer because it's no
-  python package and thus could break. mr.developer supports co option
-  egg=false ... use that.
-
-OK - index: complete the benchmark products.daterecurringindex
-
-OK - index: sync with hanno's changes to dateindex
-
-OK - TZ: provide widget for TZ field described above
-
-OK - jure - ATEvent: error when submitting random data to recurrence field. catch 
-  dateutil's error and raise validation error. display error as error message.
-
-OK - in plone.event.utils now - isSameDay, isSameTime -... taking event as parameter. change to date1, date2
-
-OK - toDisplay, doing nearly the same as function below. factor out a to_display
-function which can used in both
-
-OK - fix portal_calendar or filtered occurences. calendar portlet is showing event
-  from previous month every day.
-
-OK - avoid dependency on portal_calendar or bring that tool in here.

+ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

+
+                Preamble
+
+  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
+freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
+software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
+General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
+Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
+using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
+the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
+your programs, too.
+
+  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
+price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
+have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
+this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
+if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
+in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
+anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
+These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
+gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
+you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
+source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
+rights.
+
+  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
+patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
+program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
+program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
+patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
+a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
+under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
+refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
+means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
+that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
+either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
+language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
+the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
+running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
+is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
+Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
+Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
+source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
+conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
+copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
+notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
+and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
+along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
+of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
+distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
+above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
+    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
+    parties under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
+    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
+    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
+    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
+    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
+    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
+    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
+and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
+on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
+this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
+entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
+a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
+the scope of this License.
+
+  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
+    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
+    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
+    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
+    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
+    received the program in object code or executable form with such
+    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
+code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
+control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
+special exception, the source code distributed need not include
+anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
+form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
+operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
+itself accompanies the executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
+access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
+access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
+distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
+compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
+
+  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
+otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
+void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
+However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
+this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
+parties remain in full compliance.
+
+  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
+all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
+the Program or works based on it.
+
+  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
+restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
+You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
+this License.
+
+  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
+distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
+License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
+may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
+license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
+all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
+the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
+refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
+implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
+generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
+through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
+system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
+to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
+impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
+be a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
+may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
+those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
+countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
+the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
+of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
+be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
+address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
+later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
+either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
+Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
+this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
+Foundation.
+
+  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
+to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
+Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
+make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
+of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
+of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+                NO WARRANTY
+
+  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
+FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
+OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
+OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
+TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
+PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
+REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
+WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
+REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
+INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
+OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
+TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
+YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
+PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
+to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
+the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
+    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
+    GNU General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
+    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
+    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
+    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
+    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
+parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
+be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
+mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
+  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
+
+  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989

+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
+proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
+consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
+library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
+Public License instead of this License.

-GPL - Gnu General Public License
-================================
-
-            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-               Version 2, June 1991
-
- Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
- 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
- Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
- of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
-
-                Preamble
-
-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
-the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
-your programs, too.
-
-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
-
-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
-
-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
-rights.
-
-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
-distribute and/or modify the software.
-
-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
-authors' reputations.
-
-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
-
-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
-modification follow.
-
-            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
-
-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
-under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
-refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
-the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
-
-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
-
-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
-along with the Program.
-
-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
-
-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
-
-    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
-    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
-
-    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
-    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
-    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
-    parties under the terms of this License.
-
-    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
-    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
-    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
-    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
-    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
-    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
-    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
-    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
-    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
-    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
-
-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
-identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
-and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
-themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
-sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
-distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
-on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
-this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
-entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
-
-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
-your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
-exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
-collective works based on the Program.
-
-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
-with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
-a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
-the scope of this License.
-
-  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
-under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
-Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
-
-    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
-    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
-    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
-    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
-    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
-    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
-    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
-    customarily used for software interchange; or,
-
-    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
-    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
-    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
-    received the program in object code or executable form with such

-except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
-otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
-void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
-However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
-this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such

-these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further

-TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
-PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
-REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
-
-  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
-REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
-INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
-OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
-TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
-YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
-PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE

-    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

-The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate

-be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
-mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
-
-You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
-school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
-necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

-consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
