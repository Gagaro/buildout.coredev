+# Upgrade from pre-2.0 to 2.0 based Mockup patterns
+
+Since version 2.0, Mockup uses the Patternslib scanner and it's registry. This
+allows us to: Use Patternslib patterns with Mockup/Plone and use Mockup
+patterns with Patternslib outside of Plone. The integration with Patternslib
+require that some small changes be made to newly developed Mockup patterns:
+
+1. Patterns should now use pat-registry as dependency instead of
+   mockup-registry.
+
+        define([
+            'jquery'
+            'mockup-patterns-base',
+            'pat-registry'
+        ], function($, Base, registry) {
+
+2. Patterns' selectors are now explicitly specified via the trigger attribute.
+   For example:
+
+       var Modal = Base.extend({
+         name: 'modal',
+         trigger: '.pat-modal',
+
+3. Because of change 2, patterns now fire events via the emit method, instead
+   of the trigger method.
