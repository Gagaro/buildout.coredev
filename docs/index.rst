Introduction
============
This is the development buildout for Plone 4.2. If this is your first time here, please read ALL if the instructions below before getting started. It will save you time in the end, we promise!

This document assumes you want to fix a bug and will detail the full process. For more information on writing PLIPS, please :doc:`go here <plips>`.

STOP!
=====
Legally, you can NOT contribute code unless you have signed the :doc:`contributor agreement <agreement>`. This means that we can NOT accept pull requests from you unless this is done, so please don't put the code reviewers at risk and do it anyways. Submitting the agreement is easy (and will soon be easier) and if you want quick access and are familiar with the community, go into :doc:`irc <culture>` and ask one of the repo admins to give you access with a scanned copy of the agreement. They will get you going as fast as possible!
