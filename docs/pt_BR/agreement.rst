Contribuindo para o núcleo do Plone
===================================

Há muitas pessoas e empresas que utilizam o Plone, por isto implantamos um nível de controle de qualidade. O código fonte do Plone está hospedado em https://github.com/plone, mas somente membros do time de desenvolvedores têm permissão para fazer comits.

Enviar um acordo de contribuição não garante seu acesso ao repositório, mas sempre o guardaremos para quando você estiver pronto a contribuir. Antes de solicitar acesso ao núcleo, pedimos que você se familiarize com a comunidade, que lhe ajudará a:

1) Perguntar e, especialmente, responder perguntas no stack overflow e canal :doc:`IRC <culture>` com o intuito de conhecer quem são os desenvolvedores ativos.

2) Participar de conferências/simpósios ou participar de sprints/tuneups. Há muitas oportunidade para encontrar a comunidade e começar a contribuir com código, seja pessoalmente ou pela web. Você pode conseguir acesso imediato ao núcleo em uma conferência se as pessoas habilitadas a isto estiverem presentes.

3) Contribuir no collective. Não se preocupe em ser perfeito ou em pedir ajuda; desta forma você nos conhece e melhoramos nosso código juntos, com uma comunidade.

4) **Patches** Historicamente, encorajamos pessoas a submeter patches ao ticket collector. These tickets often rotted in place and technically, in order for us to accept your patch you must sign the contributors agreement. Se quiser contribuir com correções, assine o acordo e siga o processo padrão de pull request do Github, até que se sinta confortável para ignorar a revisão.

Quando você já estiver familiarizado com a comunidade e animado para contribuir com o núcleo:

* Preencha e assine  acordo de contribuição localizado em http://plone.org/foundation/contributors-agreement/agreement.pdf/at_download/file. Isto tanto oferece proteção de copyright quanto garante à Plone Foundation a capacidade de exercer algum controle sobre a base de código, evitando a sua apropriação anti-ética. Para saber por que o acordo é necessário, acesse http://plone.org/foundation/contributors-agreement.

Contributor’s Agreement for Plone Explained
-------------------------------------------

Prospective contributors to the Plone core code base are required to sign a
contributor’s agreement, which assigns copyright in the code to the Plone
Foundation, the non-profit organization which stewards the Plone code base.
This document explains the purposes of this, along with questions and answers
about what this means.

The Plone Contributor Agreement can be found at: 
`http://plone.org/foundation/contributors-agreement/agreement.pdf`_

About the Plone Contributor Agreement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Foundation feels that it benefits the community for a single organization
to hold the rights to Plone. Prior to the Foundation, the intellectual
property of Plone was jointly held by individual developers and by Alan
Runyan and Alexander Limi. The community members who formed the Foundation
felt that having the Foundation hold these rights provides several benefits:

1.  **Minimizing confusion / maximizing business compatibility** --
    Organizations considering adopting Plone have a simple answer for "Who
    owns this?", rather than a more complicated answer that might scare away
    the legally-cautious.
    
2.  **Trademark protection** -- By having the Foundation hold the
    trademarks and rights to the Plone branding assets, it can effectively
    protect these from unfair use.
    
3.  **Guarantee of future Open Source versions** -- The Foundation's
    contributor agreement ensures that there will **always** be an OSI-
    approved version of Plone.


Questions & Answers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What does the contributor's agreement cover?

  This agreement is for the Plone core codebase only. The Plone core codebase is 
  that code which lives in the Plone core version repositories, currently located at
  `http://dev.plone.org/plone`_ and `https://github.com/plone`_. Contributions to 
  the "Collective," currently located at `http://dev.plone.org/collective`_ and 
  `https://github.com/collective`_ are not assigned to the Plone Foundation, and 
  are made available under whatever license the project developers wish to use, 
  although add-on products that import from GPLed Plone code are of course subject 
  to the terms of the GPL, which requires derived works to be GPL licensed.

What rights will I continue to have for my contributions?
  
  Contributors are asked to transfer their intellectual property rights to the Foundation. 
  In return, they will be given back irrevocable rights to use and distribute their 
  contributions. They can even give their contributions to other Open Source projects (as 
  long as those projects are compatible with the license Plone itself is issued under) or 
  use them in non-Open Source commercial applications (if that is compatible with the license 
  Plone is under).

Do I have to sign the contributor's agreement to make checkins to the Plone core codebase?
  Yes.

Do I have to sign the contributor's agreement to submit a patch to the Plone core codebase?
  
  We enthusiastically welcome patches, but we can't merge them until you sign and return a 
  contributor's agreement. (Unless, in the judgement of the Plone Release Manager, the patch 
  is so tiny as not to constitute a "creative work." See the 
  `Policy for Contributor Agreements and Patches`_ for more detail on this policy.)

Can I grant the Plone foundation a non-exclusive license to my contributions rather than an exclusive license, so that I can contribute the same code to other projects under different terms or use the contribution for other commercial endeavors?

  Not under the current version of the contributors agreement.

Does the Foundation control use of the Plone trademark?

  Yes. In order to keep the trademark, the Foundation (or any trademark owner) must
  demonstrate that they have acted to protect it.

Will Plone always be available under an OSI-approved/Open Source license? Couldn't the Board change its mind about this?

  Plone will always be available under an OSI-approved license; this is written into 
  the language of the contributor agreement each developer and the foundation sign.

Will Plone ever be available under a non-GPL license?

  The current Plone approach states that companies can negotiate a non-GPL license. 
  Thus, the Foundation might pursue a dual-licensing (GPL and non-GPL) scheme - but, 
  at this time, the Board has not yet created any policies on this. 
  This is an important question for the community, of course, and the Foundation intends 
  to have this conversation in a transparent way.

Why would anyone want a non-GPL Plone?

  Two possible reasons: Some companies are reluctant to do in-house modifications of 
  framework-like systems (such as Plone) that are under the GPL, fearing that a clause 
  in the GPL might force them to disclose their internal work - thus wanting to license 
  it under (for example) a BSD-style license. Second, companies may wish to offer a 
  commercial version of Plone, under a conventional shrink-wrap license, without the 
  obligation to reveal source code or share changes.

How much would a non-GPL version of Plone cost?

  Would a small company be able to afford one? -- Neither the Foundation nor the Board have 
  made any decisions about a non-GPL version, let alone about pricing. However, one of the 
  Foundation's stated goals is to maintain a level playing field for Plone while trying to 
  benefit all of the Plone commons.If a non-GPL version was available, and a large company 
  bought it, added features to it, and sold it, wouldn't they be using our work without an
  obligation to give back?It's helpful to remember the core value open source provides: distributed 
  development, maintenance, security checking, and support. Companies that build large features 
  for Plone are **already** having to make decisions of whether to release their products 
  under an open source license or not (since they could always release them as a Product, not 
  as a modification to the Plone core). Despite this, though, many large and excellent 
  contributions - such as Archetypes - have been made, and the Foundation hopes that companies will 
  continue to do so. In any event, a company that purchases a non-GPL license (should such ever 
  become available) is contributing financial resources to our community, which can be used to
  further develop, market, and protect the GPL version of Plone.

	Contributing to Plone Core
	==========================

	There are many people and companies who rely on Plone on a day-to-day basis so we have to introduce some level of code quality control. Plone's source code is hosted in a git repository at  https://github.com/plone, but only members of the developer team have commit-rights. 

	Just sending in a contributors agreement does not guarantee you access to the repository, but once you send it in we will always have it on file for when you are ready to contribute. We do ask that before requesting core access you familiarize yourself a little with the community since they will help you get ramped up:

	* Ask and (especially) answer questions on stack overflow and :doc:`IRC <culture>` with a focus on getting to know the active developers a bit. 

	* Attend a conference/symposium or participate in a sprint/tuneup. There are plenty of opportunities to meet the community and start contributing through various coding sessions, either in person or on the web. You may even be able to get immediate core access at a conference if you are flexing your mad coding skills and the right people are attending.

	* Get your feet wet by contributing to the collective. Don't worry about getting it perfect or asking for help; this way you get to know us and we improve our code together as a community. 

	* **Patches** Historically we encouraged people to submit patches to the ticket collector. These tickets often rotted in place and technically, in order for us to accept your patch you must sign the contributors agreement. If you want to contribute fixes, please just sign the agreement and go through the standard github pull request  process described until you feel comfortable to bypass review.

	Once you have familiarized yourself with the community and you are excited to contribute to the core:

	* Sign and snail mail the contributor agreement at  http://plone.org/foundation/contributors-agreement/agreement.pdf/at_download/file. This offers both copyright protection and ensures that the Plone Foundation is able to exercise some control over the codebase, ensuring it is not appropriated for someone's unethical purposes. For questions about why the agreement is required, please see  http://plone.org/foundation/contributors-agreement. 

* After your form has been signed and received, fill out a trac ticket for core access at https://dev.plone.org/newticket. Make sure you are logged in and please specify "core" not collective on the trac ticket, your github username, and select the CoreAccess component. If you are not logged in, you will not be able to select a component so make sure you are logged in. If you are at a sprint, you will likely just hand this paper to the sprint

If you aren't sure where to start or just want more direction, feel free to get on IRC, mailing lists, Twitter, etc... and ask for help. While there is no official mentoring process, there are plenty of people willing to act in that role and guide you through the steps of getting involved in the community. A common way to start contributing is to participate in a Plone tune-up day. Tune-ups are filled with a good mix of newbies and experienced devs alike. For more information, please see  http://plone.org/tuneup.

Welcome to the Plone community!
