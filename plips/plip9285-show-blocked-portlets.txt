PLIP 9285: Show blocked portlets in management interface
=================================================================

This plip is in progress.

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9285

To do
-----

- Didn't branch CMFPlone for this PLIP, so when merging, some CSS nees to be
  added to CMFPlone/skins/plone_styles/portlets.css.dtml. Something like:

    .blockedPortlet .portletHeader {
        background-color: &dtml-discreetColor;;
    }


- Handle parent blocking, i.e., if for a given category, the 'blacklist status'
  is "Use parent settings", the portlets should be shown as blocked/unblocked,
  according to the parent settings.

- Portlets from global categories (and also inherited portlets) should
  probably be shown after the block/unblock select boxes.

- Add unit tests.

Summary of changes
------------------

- Changed the contextual portlet management screen to show all portlets 
  from global categories, identifying the portlets from blocked categories.


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

This PLIP includes essentially presentational improvements. The changes made 
aren't expected to break existing functionality in any way.
