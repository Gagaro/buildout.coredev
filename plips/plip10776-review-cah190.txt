PLIP 10776: Update to Zope 2.13
===============================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10776

Review by Craig Haynal (cah190@psu.edu, cah190 on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Firefox 3.6.10.


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the instructions in the plip10776-zope213.cfg file.

- Ran bin/alltests.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- There are test failures in wicked and plone.app.kss, but these
  are mentioned in the status report.

- There are some GS-related test failures in plone.app.portlets and 
  plone.app.upgrade.

- Unable to add Files or Images to a Plone site.  The types are registered
  in portal_types.  The options are missing from the Add new... menu
  and attempts to directly use createObject are causing ValueErrors.
  Perhaps a plone.app.blob issue?

- Received a BadRequest error in a call to kssValidateField while attempting
  to save an Item Type criteria for a Collection.  The criteria did save
  correctly, despite the error.

- There are a number of new deprecation warnings, but this is to be
  expected.


Conclusion
----------

Aside from the KSS issue adding collection criteria and not being
able to add Files/Images, the bulk of Plone behaved normally.
I think there needs to be some more testing and fixing of tests
before this PLIP is ready to merge, as not being able to add Image
and File objects is a big deal.
