PLIP 9250: JQuery Tools Integration
===================================

This plip is ready for review.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9250


Summary of changes
------------------

- Created plone.app.jqtools which adds jq tools as a resource and
  installs it into the js registry. It also contains licensing and
  copyright details for JQuery Tools, which is a third-party GPL/MIT
  dual-licensed plug in. All the tools *except* flash embed are included.
  
  This copy of JQ Tools is slightly customized to allow CSS-only formatting
  of overlays. I'm in communication with the JQ Tools author, who plans to
  integrate this into the next release of the overlay module.
  
  JQuery Tools documentation is available at: http://flowplayer.org/tools/
  

- Added plone.app.jqtools as dependency to Products.CMFPlone.


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

  Add section to Plone Dev Manual explaining availability of JQ Tools for
  tabs, tooltips, fancy scrolling and overlays.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

  No issues
