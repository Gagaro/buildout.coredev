PLIP 8808: Require Python 2.6, Zope 2.12, and CMF 2.2 for Plone 4.0
===================================================================

External review by Hanno Schlichting <hannosch>.

PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6 using Python 2.6.2 (64-bit).

Review steps
------------

- Reviewed a complete diff of various packages comparing the respective 3.3
  branch and the 4.0 branch. Made some small adjustments. The packages
  currently include:

  Plone
  Products.Archetypes
  Products.ATContentTypes
  Products.CMFDiffTool
  Products.CMFDynamicViewFTI
  Products.CMFEditions
  Products.CMFFormController
  Products.CMFPlacefulWorkflow
  Products.CMFQuickInstallerTool
  Products.ExtendedPathIndex


Missing steps
-------------

- Do a diff review of all changed packages comparing the code used in 3.3 vs.
  the 4.0 code.

- Do a diff review of all changed packages comparing the code used in 4.0 vs.
  the 5.0 code.

Notes and observations
----------------------

- I keep a local list right now, plenty of small issues - nothing major yet.

Conclusions
-----------

So far things look good :)
