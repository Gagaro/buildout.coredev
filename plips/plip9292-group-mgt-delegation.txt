PLIP 9292: group management delegation
======================================

http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9292

Status
------

Coming back from vacations and speeding up the job.

Finished somehow to change collective.groupdelegation such it works in Plone 4
trunk. Unit tests are OK.

https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.groupdelegation/branches/plone4-plip9292

Note that this has been done in "old style" Controler Page Template such it can
be merged to the actual (Plone 4 trunk) users and groups control panel.

Issues
------

* Actually we don't check if groups are mutable. Delegation of non mutable
  groups should be forbidden.

* To FWT: should we be in position to grant group delegation to guys who are not
  members of a group?

Todo
----

Include all this in plone.app.controlpanel. But this requires a real refactoring
of the users/groups control panels such we do all this in new style control panels.
