PLIP 10886 event improvements notes
===================================

NOTE: this plip is not finished yet.

Prerequisites
-------------
* git - Make sure, you have git installed. We use it for some checkouts from
  github and for patching.
* Don't install this plip buildout in an existing buildout. Use a fresh one.


Known Issues
------------

* plone.app.event implements archetypes based ATEvent and depends on
archetypes.datetimewidget. Archetypes dependencies should be seperated from
plone.app.event to simplify migration for Plone5, where Dexterity will be used.

* Recurrence rules are defined as RFC2445 compatible strings, which are parsed
by python-dateutil. Due to a bug in this package, timezones other than UTC based
can't be set in RFC2445 strings - although python-dateutil respects timezones in
python datetime instances. This bug affects primary RDATE components, which
define individual dates to include in the recurrence rule.
e.g. does not work: RDATE;TZID=Europe/Vienna:20101010T090000;
works: RDATE:20101010T090000Z;
This bug is reported. For now, RDATE components shouldn't be used and disabled
in the UI until this bug is fixed.
