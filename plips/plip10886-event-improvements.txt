===================================
PLIP 10886 event improvements notes
===================================

NOTE: this plip is not finished yet.

Prerequisites
=============
* git - Make sure, you have git installed. We use it for some checkouts from
  github and for patching.
* Don't install this plip buildout in an existing buildout. Use a fresh one.


Possible architectural problems
===============================
* plone.app.event implements archetypes based ATEvent and depends on
archetypes.datetimewidget. Archetypes dependencies should be seperated from
plone.app.event to simplify migration for Plone5.
