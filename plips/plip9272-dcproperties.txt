PLIP 9272: Exposing Dublin Core properties
===================================================
This PLIP is in progress.
PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9272


To do
-----
- Proper load testing
- Re-implemented listMetaTags to:
  * check "show_about" (show creator/author data)
  * use all properties, not the current "use_all" way


Further ideas
-------------
Showing a list of the exposed properties could be usefull, but more for an addon product (collective.dublincore or something like that).
Then we can also implement a way to overrule the exposed properties (ie. disable dc.creator, and )


Summary of changes
------------------
- Added field to Plone site controlpanel (https://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/28477)
- Re-added metatags loop in main_template (removed in https://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/27845#file11)


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------
- Documentation for the Plone control panel (site setup)
