PLIP 10776: Zope 2.1.3
===========================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10776

Review by Alec Mitchell (alecpm@gmail.com, alecm on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.8 using python 2.6.5 and Google
Chrome 6.0.472.62.


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip10766-zope213.cfg file.

- Ran tests bin/alltests

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.

- Ran some very simple benchmarks using ab to check if there were any
  significant performance impacts.


Notes and observations
----------------------

* There are additional test failures beyond those mentioned in the
  PLIP description:

    * A failure in plone.app.portlets.tests.test_configuration.TestGenericSetup
    * 4 errors in plone.app.upgrade.v25.tests.TestFunctionalMigrations

* The need to use an older version of the DateTime module is a bit
  worrying, but minor.

* I'm not seeing any test failures in plone.app.kss, despite an
  indication that I should expect one in the PLIP txt description.

* No obvious performance impact was found.

Conclusion
----------

Provided the test failures (including those in Wicked) are addressed
before merge, +1
