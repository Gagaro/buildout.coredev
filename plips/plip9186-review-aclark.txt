Summary
--------

As a late add & guest FWT member I didn't get a chance to spend a lot of time
on this, but I did test it TTW and it behaved as I expected.

Issues and Concerns
----------------

I notice that if you don't add a title, the form uses the filename as the id.
This is a little strange, but if I understand correctly it is to make FTP
and WebDAV to continue to work properly, and it is something I can live
with.

+1 for inclusion, pending making sure the File type behaves the same way
(I don't whether or not the File type currently behaves this way, but I 
    saw some discussion about it.)
