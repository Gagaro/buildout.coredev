PLIP 12227: In-Plone theme editor 
=================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12227

Review #2 by Alec Mitchell (alecpm@gmail.com, alecm on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.8 using python 2.7.3 and Google
Chrome 18.0.1025.165.


Review steps
------------

- Checked out git@github.com:plone/plone.app.theming.git optilude-ace
  branch and ran buildout.

- Reviewed code differences from standard plone.app.theming

- Ran tests for plone.app.theming.

- Started instance.

- Created plone site with plone.app.theming enabled.

- Cloned default theme TTW.

- Edited theme and rules  TTW.

- Uploaded zip theme from the web and tested editing (https://ploud.com/themes/banana-leaf).


Notes and observations
----------------------

- Would be nice if this had a standard plip buildout.

- Code looks fine, though much of it is integration of 3rd party
  javascript and css.

- Very much needs a reasonable default theme for users to build from.

- Need to make sure there aren't any license issues with the
  distribution of 3rd party libs/css.

- Tests all passing, but this seems like it could really use some
  js functional tests.


Conclusion
----------

This PLIP should be considered ready for merge, but needs a better
default theme before final release.  It could also use a thorough UI
review before final release.
