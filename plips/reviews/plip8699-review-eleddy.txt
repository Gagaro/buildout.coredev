The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6 and Chrome 7.0.517.44

Review steps
------------
- Run all discussion items and run tests
- Review code with eyeballs and comment in github
- Test in browser

Notes and observations
----------------------
- code is excellent and thourough, especially for such a small change - way to go!
- I'm not sure why the setting is in the security settings? This seems like a really weird place to me. I think it would go it Site maybe, or editing.
- I feel like the wording on the setting is wrong. It says "If set, object Effective Date will be used. Otherwise workflow publication date will be used.
"
But when its off, no date is displayed and when it's checked, then a date is displayed. Maybe the wording just needs updated? 
-I find the bahavior of only displaying publication date if they are the same pretty confusing (e.g. If I set an effective date manually, it shows effective date AND last modified. If I don't set an effective date and rely on workflow publication, it shows workflow published date but no last modified. I would expect that last modified shows for both cases or neither.) Is there some text or something that can indicate they are the same? I had to re-read the plip to realize this was as expected and not a bug. At minimum this needs to be documented in the user manual but its such a small thing that I think could be resolved with better wording.

TODO
----
- RE: translation, plone.app.locales should be updated in the security control panel. Feel free to ask the i18n team for help though :)
- RE: documentation, I would prefer that the plone user manual indicate this somewhere, I think it should be sufficient to update it here: http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-4-user-manual/using-collections/using-and-understanding-dates 
I'm sure there are docs all over but this is the minimum IMO.
- Update wording in control panel to be clearer on setting
- Move setting out of security to.... TBD
- Potentially clarify same pub and modified date... will get feedback

Conclusion
----------
Excellent implementation. I'm +1 for merge although there are a few small tasks that should happen before release. My biggest concern is the location of the new setting. Will discuss with FWT to suggest an alternative.
