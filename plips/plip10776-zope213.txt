Status of Zope 2 release
------------------------

Currently Zope 2.13 is still in alpha stage. A beta release is blocking on a
Zope Toolkit beta or rc1 release. The ZTK release team decided to go from the
current ZTK 1.0a3 straight to a rc1 once all tests for all supported platforms
pass. It's not too many failing tests left and hopefully this will be cleaned
up during September 2010.

A Zope 2.13 rc1 will also block on a ZODB 3.10 rc1. Currently there's a beta6
and Jim indicated that he wants a rc1 soon. The missing bit before going to a
rc1 is to review all the bugs in the Launchpad tracker. Since Jim is actively
working on things, this shouldn't take more than a couple weeks at most.

Both of these activities could be speed up by other volunteers helping out.

Apart from the above, the Zope 2.13 code is considered to be stable and
qualifies for a rc itself. There's likely going to be a number more ZCatalog
related features going into it, though these shouldn't destabilize the code or
require any adjustments in downstream code.
