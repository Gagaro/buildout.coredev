PLIP 8802: Move our upgrade / migration infrastructure to GenericSetup
======================================================================

External review by Hanno Schlichting <hannosch>.

PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6 using Python 2.6.2 (64-bit).

Review steps
------------

- Did a manual review of the code in Plone (migration tool).

- Did a manual review of all code in plone.app.upgrade.

- Created a stock Plone 2.5 Data.fs, copied it into a Plone 4.0 site and ran
  the upgrade. Poked around the UI and did all the common editing and site
  admin operations.

- Created a full GenericSetup export of am upgraded 2.5 site and compared it
  to a pristine export for a Plone 4.0 site.

Notes and observations
----------------------

- The GenericSetup Upgrades tab is pretty unfriendly. We should consider to
  let it display the currently active baseline profiles per default (thus
  making it CMFPlone:plone) and not CMFDefault. We should also mark the
  CMFDefault upgrade steps as being run (manually setting its profile version
  to 2.2 instead of unknown). That should help avoid some confusion of people
  trying to run those steps.

- When upgrading from Plone 2.5, the Kupu control panel is named
  "Kupu visual editor" and in the add-ons section. It should be "Visual Editor"
  and be in the "Plone Configuration" section. "Workflow policies" is missing
  its icon.

- The markup control panel points to "@@language-controlpanel".

- In a site upgraded from 2.5, inline editing is enabled. We could be smarter
  and disable it for these sites. For sites starting out from Plone 3.0 we
  wouldn't touch the value.

- placeful_workflow_configuration.pt throws an error for document_byline as
  found in "here/document_byline/macros/byline"

- The workflow drop-down tries to do KSS actions, but nothing happens. The KSS
  error console in Firebug shows a NotFound error for the content_status_modify
  script. Invoking the script manually works.

- Doing a full GenericSetup export of all steps, throws an AttributeError on
  image_types for the ATCT tool step. Via:
  Products.ATContentTypes.exportimport.atcttool, line 165, in exportATCTTool
  ...
  Products.ATContentTypes.exportimport.atcttool, line 27, in _exportNode
  ...
  Module OFS.PropertyManager, line 151, in getProperty

  Looking at the ZMI screen of the ATCT tool, the properties are present but
  lack the checkbox in front. The tool has no _properties in its __dict__. So
  the properties registrations are missing.

- When attempting to do an upgrade for a Plone 2.1 site, Zope starts fine.
  Accessing anything inside the Plone site (ZMI or public site) throws the
  following error: "'GroupUserFolder' object is not iterable". We should
  document this, so it can be found via Google and tell people about the proper
  two-step upgrade procedure.
