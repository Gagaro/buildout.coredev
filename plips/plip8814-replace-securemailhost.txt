PLIP 8814: Replace SecureMailHost with a standard Zope mailhost
==============================================

This plip is in progress.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8814


To do
-----

- Add migration for existing sites.

- Products.MailHost.MailHost makes it difficult to set a charset for
  the message

- Products.MailHost.MailHost doesn't allow From headers different from
  the envelope sender.

- Products.MailHost.MailHost does not handle unicode messages.

- Products.MailHost.MailHost treats message bodies with a ':' in them
  as headers!!


Summary of changes
------------------

- Use MailHost instead of SecureMailHost on install

- Remove references to secureSend and other SecureMailHost API calls
  from Products.CMFPlone and plone.app.contentrules

- Add backwards compatibility patches to ensure 3rd party code that
  uses secureSend, validateSingleNormalizedEmailAddress,
  validateSingleEmailAddress, or validateEmailAddresses continues to
  work but produces deprecation warnings.

- Add deprecated import of EMAIL_RE and EMAIL_CUTOFF_RE, since those
  are essentially public APIs of SecureMailHost.


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

- Document method deprecations


Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

No known issues.
