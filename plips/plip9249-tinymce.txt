PLIP 9249: Add TinyMCE as the default visual editor
===================================================

This plip is in progress.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9249


To do
-----

- Testing


Further ideas
-------------

The control panel of TinyMCE is currently in the Add-on section and
the control panel for Kupu is called "Visual editor" and is located
in the "Plone Configuration" section. This might confuse users.


Summary of changes
------------------

- Added Products.TinyMCE as dependency to Products.CMFPlone.

- Install Products.TinyMCE automatically when a new Plone Site is
  added.

- Removed Products.TinyMCE from the uninstall view of Quick Installer.

- Set tinymce as the default editor for new users.


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

The Plone 3 User Manual (located at: 
http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-3-user-manual) needs to be
updated and replace the Kupu features with the TinyMCE ones. See:
http://plone.org/products/tinymce/documentation/manual/tinymce-user-manual
for the documentation currently available for TinyMCE.

http://plone.org/products/tinymce/documentation/ also contains other
user, integrator and developer documentation.


Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

Kupu is still available in Plone 4 so all users are still able to
use that. HTML filter settings are used both in Kupu and TinyMCE
so no compatibility issues there either. Settings from the Kupu
control panel are also available in the TinyMCE control panel.
These need to be migrated manually.
