PLIP 9329: Manage actions through Plone
=======================================

Review #1 by Eric Steele, on behalf of the FWT (ems174@psu.edu, esteele on irc)

PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.5.7 using python 2.6.2 and Firefox 3.5.2.

Review steps
------------

 - Ran buildout using the plip9315-new-theme.cfg file.

 - Visual inspection of the code
 
 - Start Zope, create new Plone site, install plonetheme.sunburst
 
Notes and observations
---------------------- 

* Breaks tests in Products.CMFPlone, plone.app.upgrade.

* Nice, clean design.

* No breadcrumbs.

* Less !importants (13). !Yay

* CSS is much easier to read.

* I'm seeing the dropdown menus hide behind elements like the footer.

* Line running through fieldset tabs in /edit views.

* Lack of contrast between background of fields with validation errors and the error message (red on salmon).

* Quite a bit of text throughout the site tiny to the point of being nearly unreadable (navtree, search results).

Conclusions 
-----------
Fix breaking tests. 

There's a lot of work to do before considering this finished and I'm not going
to spend time picking at minor design details in this review.

I like the design. I like the general idea behind the changes made. Consider
me +1 on inclusion, assuming it's finished at 5some point.
