PLIP 10776: Include Zope 2.13
==============================================================

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10776

Review #2 by Elizabeth Leddy (eleddy)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.4 using python 2.6.6 and Chrome 6.0.4


Review steps
------------

- Ran buildout using the plip10776-zope213.cfg file.

- Ran all tests

- Created a new Plone site and tried to File


Notes and observations
----------------------

- Plone 25 upgrade tests are failing in addition to Wicked. I did not see
  the generic setup errors that Alec did.
- I was experiencing a weird issue (below) testing so I went back to old zope and then
  all the sudden everything was hosed. I know downgrading doesn't happen often but
  it did concern me a bit and I think it should at minimum be noted somewhere
- Add file and image are NOT in my "Add new..." dropdowns. JaRoel confirmed on his
  4.1 zope 2.12 build that they were there. There is no warning or error in the
  logs. I was logged in as the admin so permissions shouldn't be an issue.


Conclusion
----------
I really want to see 2.13 in the next release but I had a lot of issues with this.
I don't think it should be merged as is.
