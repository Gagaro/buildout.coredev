PLIP 9315: New theme for Plone 4
================================

Note: Some viewlets should be disabled manually when testing: Breadcrumbs should
be hidden, Site Actions (accessibility, site map) should be in the footer (or
just disable when testing). This will be added to the default setup later.

The theme uses HTML5 (the XHTML variant), so there are some new tags in the
markup. To learn about proper use of these if you're new to HTML5:

- section/article use: http://boblet.tumblr.com/post/130610820/html5-structure1
- header use: http://boblet.tumblr.com/post/134276674/html5-structure2
- nav/aside/footer use: http://boblet.tumblr.com/post/134732913/html5-structure3

HTML5 renders fine even in older browsers - the only issue is that styling these
elements doesn't work in certain browsers (like IE6), which is why we have kept
the old <div>s. There might be a way to make this work with Dean Edwards'
scripts for IE6/7, but we'll have to do more testing before we know whether this
is a good enough approach.

We haven't done much cleanup of the markup, this is intentional since we want to
target this for Plone 5 instead. The goal has been that most Plone 3 themes that
have their own CSS should continue to work in Plone 4. Let me know if you see
otherwise.

The idea is to ship with the old default theme installed, so that upgraded sites
that are using it will keep their styling. It should be separated out into a
separate product, though. It is a goal to have at least two entries in the
Themes control panel, so people see that Plone can look very different
immediately after a first install.

Known issues that remain:
- Look in main_template for TODO markers; I'm hoping we can simplify or remove
  some of the more complex TAL expressions. Help appreciated. :)
- Instead of using base_properties (which doesn't make much sense since there's 
  only two colors in the theme), I'm going to move all the color definitions to 
  two CSS selectors that will be listed first in the CSS file, so they are easy 
  to change. This will happen once we are closer to completion.
- If ZPT can't be fixed to include a DOCTYPE on all documents similar to what 
  Chameleon does, we need to have a METAL header like the Plone 3 theme. I'm 
  hoping we can fix this in ZPT, though.
- Portlet styling is still in-progress
- Not using the Resource Registry for CSS yet
- Theme is not split up in multiple files yet — we'll probably do a simple 
  public/edit interface split to encourage reuse, but not as many files as Plone 
  3.
- No IE6/7 testing done yet. If you find IE8 issues, let us know — it should be 
  working there.
- Personal bar is supposed to be a pulldown menu, but isn't yet.
- Kupu doesn't work yet. Not sure why.
- Manage portlets screen doesn't show any portlets. Not sure why.
- Editing CSS is still not complete.
- Print and mobile CSS are not supplied yet.
- The plan is to get rid of most of the unnecessary icons (copy/paste, etc), and 
  possibly make the standard folder/page icons etc more color-neutral 
  (black&white is one option).
