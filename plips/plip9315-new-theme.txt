PLIP 9315: New theme for Plone 4
================================

Note: Some viewlets should be disabled manually when testing: Breadcrumbs should
be hidden, Site Actions (accessibility, site map) should be in the footer (or
just disable when testing). This will be added to the default setup later.

The theme uses HTML5 (the XHTML variant), so there are some new tags in the
markup. To learn about proper use of these if you're new to HTML5:

- section/article use: http://boblet.tumblr.com/post/130610820/html5-structure1
- header use: http://boblet.tumblr.com/post/134276674/html5-structure2
- nav/aside/footer use: http://boblet.tumblr.com/post/134732913/html5-structure3

HTML5 renders fine even in older browsers - the only issue is that styling these
elements doesn't work in certain browsers (like IE6), which is why we have kept
the old <div>s. There might be a way to make this work with Dean Edwards'
scripts for IE6/7, but we'll have to do more testing before we know whether this
is something that works well enough in real-life cases.

The theme does not use tables for layout, but makes use of the new grid layout 
CSS from Plone 5 instead. This should work in all browsers, including IE6.

Overall, the goal is to have older browsers (IE6, IE7) functional, but we won't 
bend over backwards to get it pixel-perfect identical to browsers that support 
CSS2/3. Rounded corners are only shown in browsers that support it via CSS3, for 
instance.

We haven't done much cleanup of the markup, this is intentional since we want to
target this for Plone 5 instead. The goal has been that most Plone 3 themes that
have their own CSS should continue to work in Plone 4. Let me know if you see
otherwise.

The idea is to ship with the old default theme installed, so that upgraded sites
that are using it will keep their styling. It should be separated out into a
separate product, though. It is a goal to have at least two entries in the
Themes control panel, so people see that Plone can look very different
immediately after a first install.


Known issues / to do:
- Look in main_template for TODO markers; I'm hoping we can simplify or remove
  some of the more complex TAL expressions. Help appreciated. :)
- If ZPT can't be fixed to include a DOCTYPE on all documents similar to what 
  Chameleon does, we need to have a METAL header like the Plone 3 theme. I'm 
  hoping we can fix this in ZPT, though.
- Portlet styling is still in-progress
- Theme is not split up in multiple files yet — we'll probably do a simple 
  public/edit interface split to encourage reuse, but not as many files as Plone 
  3.
- No IE6/7 testing done yet. If you find IE8 issues, let us know — it should be 
  working there.
- No RTL testing/updates done yet.
- Personal bar is supposed to be a pulldown menu with log out, profile, 
  dashboard and site setup links, but isn't yet.
- Editing CSS is still not complete.
- The plan is to get rid of most of the unnecessary icons (copy/paste, etc), and 
  possibly make the standard folder/page icons etc more color-neutral 
  (black & white is one option).
- We'll probably add in branches for things like the breadcrumb cleanup and 
  other happytalk removal/simplification, but we haven't started this yet.
- The old CMFPlone theme should be separated out into its own product.
