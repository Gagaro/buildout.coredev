PLIP 9327: unified interface for lists of content
=================================================

PLIP ticket: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9327

Review by Craig Haynal (cah190@psu.edu, cah190 on irc)

The PLIP was reviewed on Mac OS X 10.6.5 using python 2.6.6 and Camino
2.0.6.


Review steps
------------

- Ran the plip9327-contentlisting.cfg buildout.

- Ran tests for plone.app.contentlisting.

- Ran alltests.

- Created and examined a new Plone site to look for any obvious issues.

- Examined code.


Notes and observations
----------------------

- Tests for plone.app.contentlisting all pass and have good coverage.

- alltests shows nothing unusual.

- This PLIP does not appear to have any user-facing components and does
not alter existing listing views.  In the long-run it is probably
desirable to update the Plone built-in listing views to use this API,
but it may be too drastic for a dot release.

- The API seems straightforward, though definitely needs some
documentation beyond the code extract in docs/summary.txt.

- Why are ContentListing and BaseContentListingObject old-style classes?

- The BaseContentListingObject class has an __eq__ method comparing
UIDs, would it be better to leverage the uuid support to avoid
relying on Archetypes UIDs?

- RealContentListingObject exposes the UID, should it also expose
uuid, as non-Archetypes objects may not support UIDs?


Conclusion
----------

At a minimum this PLIP needs some additional documentation on the new
contentlisting API.  I think this would be a good occasion to add some
integration with the plone.app.uuid PLIP's API.  I am -1 to merge right
now, but if the documentation issue is addressed I will be in favor of
merging.
