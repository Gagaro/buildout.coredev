PLIP 9288: Improved commenting infrastructure
=============================================

This plip is in progress.

Plip ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9288

Progress tracker: http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/15135

Known Issues / Todo
-------------------

 - Clear and rebuild looses all comments.
 - Validation for reply-to-comment forms is not working (the post-comment form is working fine).

Summary of changes
------------------

As described in PLIP 9288, a new commenting system was implemented with the following features:

 - Basic commenting functionality: Users can post comments or reply to existing comments.
 - Moderation: It is possible to enable moderation so that every comment has to be reviewed before publishing.
 - Captcha support: If plone.formwidget.captcha is installed
 - Mass editing screen: Like in Wordpress, there is a moderation view for batch editing comments.
 - Configurable and extensible comment forms: Using z3c.form for the commenting forms allows for components to extend the comment form or to hide/reorder existing fields.
 - Migration: It is possible to migrate the old comment system to the new one.

Further ideas
-------------

- Notification (portlet, mail)

- RichText and intelligenttext comments

- Akismet spam protection

- ReCaptcha

- Auto-approve whitelist

- IP blacklist

- Comment pagination

- Migration from other commenting add-ons (qPloneComments, iqpp.plone.commenting)

For a complete list of ideas see: http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/15135


Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

To my knowledge, there is no documentation about the current commenting system on plone.org.

Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

There is a migration script to migrate comments.
