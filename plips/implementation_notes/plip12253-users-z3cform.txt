PLIP #12253 implementation notes (Use z3c.form in plone.app.users)
==================================================================

Implementers: Vitaliy Podoba and Jamie Lentin
PLIP text: http://dev.plone.org/ticket/12253

Reference buildout is at git://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev.git; run with
-c plips/plip12253-users-z3cform.cfg. 


How to test
-----------

PLIP buildout configuration includes collective.examples.userdata package. But
as long as you do not install it in quick installer tool, it won't influence
plone.app.users functionality as it's form extenders are registered for it's
package layer interface.

End user forms to check:

* registration form
* user preferences form
* personal information form
* change password form

Management forms to check:

* Add new user form
* Member Registration control panel (accessible via tab inside Users and Groups
  panel)

Please, check README.txt in plone.app.users and
collective.examples.userdata packages to get an idea how it all works.


Notes
-----

* we haven't added Deprecation Warnings yet, not sure where should we insert it,
  into form classes, or at modules import time?

* as stated in PLIP description, we do not support ISchemaProvider approach and
  instead switched to using IFormExtender (from plone.z3cform) to allow
  developers extend user related forms in a more generic way

* also we have our own schema adapter class which overrides __setattr__ and
  __getattr__ methods to avoid code duplication for every new field in user
  schema; so we add extra setter and getter only if we need to handle some user
  property in a special way, it'll still work
