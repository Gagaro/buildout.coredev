- adding a new collection, what is allowed users and roles supposed to
  filter on? it doesn't seem to filter on anything
TODO: This filter should allow the end user to create a collection that contains documents on which user 'x' as the View permission.
Portal_catalog checks the View permission for the current user. Maybe we can use unrestrictedSearch if this filter is used.

- Once I add a criteria, then try to add another one that is the same, the
  results end up being a little weird. For example, I have description and
  the word "tomato" with three results. then add another description field
  with no words at all and I get 21 results. I would expect these to be
  an intersection, although I could be wrong since there is no indication.
  I think its just a bug though.
XXX: remove index when used, or merge criteria?


- It would be nice if the query did not submit and filter
  until after the user enters something in the box. I often found myself adding
  a filter and then wanting to see what I had in the live search but it was gone.
  This also makes sense in cases where the filter does not apply to the objects being
  displayed (e.g. event start and end date)
TODO: would be nice.

- Also nice to have is not to delete the contents of a box if I switch to
  another criteria and then decide to come back. This makes sense if I'm
  trying to decide between using title, description, or searchable text for
  example
XXX: would be nice.

- More nice to have is that for items where you have no other choices for the
  type of query (e.g Description "is" versus Locations rel/abs choice) I would
  like to see that be text instead of a drop down. This control makes me wonder
  as the end user if I should check for more options each time and the majority
  of the time I don't need to.
XXX: would be nice.

- when adding the related to field I immediately get an error:

- The query field widget could use some better documentation.

- The GenericSetup profiles need better titles and descriptions so
  that users can know what they're looking at when installing add-ons.
TODO: fix profile titles
INFO: Fixed in r50430 (also in dependency packages)

- The criteria value dropdowns are styled differently than other
  dropdowns.
TODO: fix styling for custom widgets

- plone.app.collection, plone.app.querystring and
  archetypes.querywidget are in dire need of comments, docstrings and
  more complete interfaces for developer/maintenance documentation
  purposes.  It's far to difficult to approach and understand how
  things fit together as-is.
TODO: create docs + overview image etc

- The javascriptDisabled validator seems distasteful to me, but I
  might not be understanding it.  Why is this necessary and is there
  really no better way?
TODO: explain in docs why this works the way it does.
INFO: this is necessary to create a validation error.
      the validation error is needed to stay in in the current form,
      which keeps archetypes from creating a temp object in portal_factory and
      losing the request.
      it's a bit hacky, i totally agree but i could not find a better way so
      far, after discussing this with several people.
      i've updated the docstrings in the python file.

- I love how small plone.app.collection is.
Me too!
XXX: convert to Dexterity?

- I don't see any unit tests for the JS.
INFO: There are unit tests in archetypes.querywidget > tests > javascripts
