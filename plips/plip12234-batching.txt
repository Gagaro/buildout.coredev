PLIP #12235 implementation notes (Unify batching)
=================================================

Implementer: Tom Gross
PLIP text: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/12235

Reference buildout is at git://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev.git; run with
-c plips/plip12234-batching.cfg. 

I introduced a new package plone.batching. This package is supposed to do
*all* batching in Plone. It has 100% test coverage.

I pointed all known batching implementations to plone.batching and removed
all custom batching code. The known batches are in

 - Products.CMFPlone.PloneBatch (e.g. search)
 - plone.app.content (e.g. folder_contents)
 - plone.z3cform (e.g. ??? -> singing and dancing).

I plan to add developer documentation of how to use batches in custom code
and templates.
