PLIP 9286: Allow to show/hide portlets
=================================================================

This plip is in progress.

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9286

To do
-----

- Links for show/hide options should use specific symbols. Currently, they
  are only text links.

- Use different style for hidden portlets. This needs to take into account
  plip #9285, which also adds new style to identify blocked portlets.

- More tests.

- GenericSetup import/export step to handle hidden property in
  old instances of plone.portlet.static.

Summary of changes
------------------

- Added new options show/hide to portlet management screen. Hidden portlets
  are shown in the management screen, but not when viewing.
  The implementation strategy is based on a new feature to add in
  plone.portlets (portlet assignment settings) that basically consists of a
  list of settings (per assignment) that can be also used by other
  implementations. By default, there is only the 'visible' setting.

- Removed field 'hide' from plone.portlet.static's schema, and added 
  deprecation message for the use of the 'hide' parameter at
  static.Assignment's contructor.

Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

- The Plone User Manual needs to be updated, more specifically the "Portlet
  Management" section:
  http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-3-user-manual/portlet-management/


Backwards compatibiliy
-----------------------

Migration for legacy static portlets not implemented yet.

Review
------

- Could we factor up the repetition between hide_portlet and show_portlet at
  https://dev.plone.org/old/plone/browser/plone.app.portlets/branches/plip9286-allow-show-hide-portlets/plone/app/portlets/browser/editmanager.py?rev=29095#L282 ?

- Do we even want "specific symbols" for hide and show? Sometimes a word is
  worth a thousand pictures.

- Another out-of-scope niggle: I assigned a portlet at the root of the site and
  was surprised I couldn't click "hide" at some lower level's Manage Portlets
  page. (It took me several few minutes to figure out where to see the new Hide
  link!) I can't change the ordering at inherited levels either, so at least
  you're consistent. However, I'd expect to be able to move and change the
  visibility of any portlet anywhere I can see it. After all, I can still click
  its title and edit its params. Since you're such a portlet jockey, do you have
  any idea how big a deal that would be to implement?

- As the to-do section says, this PLIP isn't done yet. We should probably do a
  migration for people who upgrade straight from the old plone.portlet.static to
  2.0, but your migrate-as-we-go code at
  https://dev.plone.org/old/plone/browser/plone.portlet.static/branches/plip9286-allow-show-hide-portlets/plone/portlet/static/static.py?rev=29096#L79
  goes a long way.

All in all, great work so far. I can't see anything wrong with your code.
