PLIP 9286: Allow to show/hide portlets
=================================================================

This plip is in progress.

PLIP ticket: https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9286

To do
-----

- Links for show/hide options should use specific symbols. Currently, they
  are only text links.

- Use different style for hidden portlets. This needs to take into account
  plip #9285, which also adds new style to identify blocked portlets.

- More tests.

- GenericSetup import/export step to handle hidden property in
  old instances of plone.portlet.static.

Summary of changes
------------------

- Added new options show/hide to portlet management screen. Hidden portlets
  are shown in the management screen, but not when viewing.
  The implementation strategy is based on a new feature to add in
  plone.portlets (portlet assignment settings) that basically consists of a
  list of settings (per assignment) that can be also used by other
  implementations. By default, there is only the 'visible' setting.

- Removed field 'hide' from plone.portlet.static's schema, and added 
  deprecation message for the use of the 'hide' parameter at
  static.Assignment's contructor.

Needed documentation changes
----------------------------

- The Plone User Manual needs to be updated, more specifically the "Portlet
  Management" section:
  http://plone.org/documentation/manual/plone-3-user-manual/portlet-management/


Backwards compatibiliy
-----------------------

Migration for legacy static portlets not implemented yet.
